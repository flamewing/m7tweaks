Section 1: About
----
This is a (for now, small) collection of convenience tweaks, cheats and fixes. It makes a few things slightly more convenient than they were in the original game, particularly if you are playing for the 100th time.

See Section III for the list of available components.

Section 2: Installation
----
BGII is required. ToB is required for many components, optional for the others. BGT, BG2EE and EET are all supported.

I have tested this with a hefty collection of mods stacked on top of each other, so you should be safe in most scenarios.

Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory and run (double-click on) "setup-m7tweaks.exe".

First, pick your favorite language. Currently available languages:

- American English

Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always
uninstall them later by re-running "setup-m7tweaks.exe".

As a rule, you do *not* need to start a new game to take advantage of anything you installed; exceptions are noted in the component descriptions.

Section 3: Components
----
1. **Convenient Deck of Many Things: Always win against Aesgareth.** As the name implies, Aesgareth is changed so that he always loses against you in the 3 draws. This results in him attacking at the end when he loses the gem, so be warned.

2. **Convenient/Cheesy/Cheating Deck of Many Things.** This is aimed at reducing the number of reloads until you get what you want from the deck. This component is subdivided into four subcomponents; all of these subcomponents have one modification in common: they make the 'Star' card more convenient and flexible. By this I mean: you get an expanded stat selection, which takes into account all of a classes 'prime requisite' attributes (Paladins can increase Charisma, for example) from 2nd edition AD&D, as well as allowing you to chose which stat bonus you get -- a multiclass Fighter/Mage/Thief can elect to gain a Strength bonus, for example, instead of gaining a Dexterity increase as in vanilla. This component has the following subcomponents with the specified additional effect:

	*2a. Convenient:* Select from normal available choices in each draw. You can select which card you will receive in this draw. The only difference from the original game is that you no longer have to reload until you get the card you want :-)

	*2b. Convenient Plus:* As above, but ignore 'Bad Card' restrictions. Normally, the second and third draws have different selections if you draw a 'bad' card (e.g., Donjon) in an earlier draw. This component works as 2a, but it lifts this restriction.

	*2c. Cheesy:* All cards can be selected in any of the 3 draws. This component combines all cards you could possibly get from the deck into a single list shown in each of the 3 draws you get. For example, you could select 'Star' 3 times for the stat bonuses.

	*2d. Cheating:* As the cheesy version, but with infinite draws. 'Balance' card is added as a choice for when you get tired of ruining the game :-)

3. **Convenient/Cheating Machine of Lum the Mad.** This component eliminates the need to remember and select the combinations for the Machine of Lum the Mad. This component is subdivided into two subcomponents, both of which have the side-effect of disabling random combinations. The subcomponents have the following additional effects:

	*3a. Convenient:* You can simply select the desired result. Pick from the descriptive list and you are done. This obeys all of the standard restrictions -- that is, each combination can be selected only once.

	*3b. Cheating:* As above, but with infinite stat bonuses. As 3a, but you can select the stat bonuses and magic resistance bonus until you suck all the fun from the game.

4. **Fix uncharming of Glaicas (De'Arnise Hold).** This allows Glaicas to be properly saved without recourse to luck. Cast your strongest charm spell and he will be correctly uncharmed. This is not needed in BG2EE or EET, and is skipped instead.

Section 4: Known Bugs
----
The Glaicas component may result in him attacking (or being attacked) after the charm is dispelled. This can be avoided by disabling party AI when confronting him.

You can't select a random combination anymore in the Machine of Lum the Mad.
